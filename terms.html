      <p><strong>Last updated: April 10, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using any mobile application (the "Service") operated by Staple Games, LLC ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

      <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

      <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

      <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>
      <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.</p>

      <p>We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h2>
      <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms & Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the Promotion rules will apply.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a weekly, monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

      <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Staple Games, LLC cancels it. For iOS Apps, you may cancel your Subscription renewal through the online account associated with your Apple ID. For Google Play Apps, you may cancel your Subscription renewal online through your Google Play Account.</p>

      <h2>Free Trial</h2>
      <p>Staple Games, LLC may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>

      <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>

      <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged until the Free Trial is over. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

      <p>At any time and without notice, Staple Games, LLC reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

      <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
      <p>Staple Games, LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

      <p>Staple Games, LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

      <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Staple Games, LLC and its licensors.

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

      <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

      <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
